	"description": "As the Wifi antenna did not work out all the time, users switched to the Gigacube SIM-based Wifi network. This however made it necessary to dial into the VPN manually, which is awkward and reduces the performance.\n\n\nWe also observed that colleagues sometimes disconnect from the VPN in order to free up bandwidth. Afterwards they tend to forget about dialing in again, which brings them to internal apps and websites that do not work immediately.",
