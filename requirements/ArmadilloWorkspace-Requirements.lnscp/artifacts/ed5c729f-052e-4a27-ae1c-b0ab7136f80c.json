The following periphals were likely being connected:\n- Mouse\n- HDMI display\n- USB and USB-C charging\n\n\nThe problem is that modern laptops do not provide many connections anymore (e.g. only two USB-C ports for a modern MacBook Pro 13\").\n\n\nTherefore most users have an USB-C peripheral adapter as a key additional hub.",
