	"description": "Though it is not very convenient for frequently changing the position between standing and sitting, we could offer manual leg extensions that can be used to extend the legs to a different height. This does not require expensive equipment such as motors.\n\n\nIn outdoor office situations you can also put the desk on a natural hill in order to \"produce\" a standing table.\n\n\nIn the home office situation, the employer could also send two small versions of the table so that standing and sitting is just about switching from one side to another."
