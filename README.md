üí° It started with a crazy idea... due to Corona, we were all working in our home offices, joining remote only.

üéä And it worked fabulously. We saw: digital work can literally be done from anywhere. Remote-first is the new way of working!

ü§î So why - during summer time - shouldn't we be working together outdoors? Because of disturbing screen reflections, challenging weather conditions or limited privacy? No! This might be challenging - but definitely doable.

üí™ So - we as UX professional sat together and re-invented the way of working remotely. Together. Anywhere.

## Why
We are digital design professionals, UX designers and software engineers working remotely together with clients around the world. We are students, singles, mothers, dads, nerds, gamers and a lot more. As we like each other, we wanted to see each other in person more often, however, without loosing the flexible home office standards that Corona brought to us all. That's why we thought: it is time to reinvent digital, screen-based workspaces. Now and forever.

## How
Our approach is to work outdoors as much as possible, especially during summer time, because outdoors we can pick any large meeting place we like, without paying the rent for an inflexible four-wall-trapped office space. But apart from summer time, you can use the Armadillo desk also as mobile desk in your limited home office space.

Here is how you jumpstart into building your own Armadillo Desk:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Watch our DIY teaser video to get inspired!
2Ô∏è‚É£ Checkout this GitHub repository on your local harddrive
3Ô∏è‚É£ Register with LeanScope, the tool that will provide you with the building instructions: https://app.leanscope.io
4Ô∏è‚É£ Launch LeanScope and open the ResearchAndDevelopment-Spec.lnscp file using LeanScope
5Ô∏è‚É£ Go to the Step by Step instructions scenario and start the "Story Player"


## What
The heart of our project is the Armadillo Outdoor desk that can be used inside and outside and is optimized for mobility, screen work and removing sunbeams. It is made to have a good time at work. You can find the entire building process including 3D printing files and user test videos in this repository. Have fun and join the movement!
