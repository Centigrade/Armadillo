üí° It started with a crazy idea... due to Corona, we were all working in our home offices, joining remote only.

üéä And it worked fabulously. We saw: digital work can literally be done from anywhere. Remote-first is the new way of working!

ü§î So why - during summer time - shouldn't we be working together outdoors? Because of disturbing screen reflections, challenging weather conditions or limited privacy? No! This might be challenging - but definitely doable.

üí™ So - we as UX professional sat together and re-invented the way of working remotely. Together. Anywhere.

## Why
We are digital design professionals, UX designers and software engineers working remotely together with clients around the world. We are students, singles, mothers, dads, nerds, gamers and a lot more. As we like each other, we wanted to see each other in person more often, however, without loosing the flexible home office standards that Corona brought to us all. That's why we thought: it is time to reinvent digital, screen-based workspaces. Now and forever.

## What
The heart of our project is the Armadillo Mobile desk that can be used inside and outside and is optimized for mobility and outdoor screen work. It is made to have a good time at work. 

## How
As you see, our favorite approach is to work outdoors as much as possible, especially during summer time. But regardless from summer time, you can use the Armadillo desk also as mobile desk in your limited home office space.
